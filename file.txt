I see you in the dark
Corner of the street
Calling after me, yeah
Headlights on full beam
Coming down the fast lane
Coming after me
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
Blowing holes in everything
Thatcher's children
See you on the way back down
Drooling Looney Tunes
Movin' in a swarm
Movin' in a swarm
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
Na-da-da-da-da-da
Na-da-da-da-da-da, yeah
Na-da-da-da-da-da
Na-da-da-da-da-da, yeah
Nowadays I get panicked
I cease to exist
I have ceased to exist
I feel absolutely nothin'
The words are out of ink
The words you know are out of ink
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
Na-da-da-da-da-da
Na-da-da-da-da-da, yeah
Na-da-da-da-da-da
Na-da-da-da-da-da, yeah
